# famous_paintings_db
An SQL Case Study and Workflow Documentation

This pdf serves to document the SQL knowledge and skills I
acquired through dedicated self-study and practice.

In order to demonstrate my abilities in a practical manner, I have
- **acquired a dataset** about famous paintings,
- **transformed** it into a **database** using *Python* and *PostgreSQL*,
- created an Entity Relationship Diagram (**ERD**) to clearly visualize
relations between information tables,
- and performed **SQL queries** giving insights into the data based on
a variety of questions.

The idea for this project was found in this YouTube tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ29DXaJ1Ts

The execution and solution of the tasks was all up to me and I furthermore
have extended the concepts and approaches introduced in the video to
make this SQL Case Study my own.
